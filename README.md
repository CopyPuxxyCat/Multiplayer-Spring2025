 Multiplayer Shooting Game using Photon Pun 2
 I started this project as part of a course on Udemy, and later I expanded it by implementing a few features myself.

 This is a real-time multiplayer shooting game developed in Unity using Photon (PUN 2) for networking. Players can join dynamic, action-packed arenas where they team up or compete against each other. The game features smooth and low-latency multiplayer interactions, thanks to Photonâ€™s reliable networking system. In addition, I integrated PlayFab to manage player data, including user profiles and in-game leaderboards.

It includes core multiplayer mechanics such as player movement, shooting, and synchronization, offering a responsive and seamless gameplay experience.
Ongoing: Gun bying in game, Login with google, bomb plant play mode...
